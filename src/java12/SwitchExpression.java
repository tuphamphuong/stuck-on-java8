        //The new Syntax removes the need for break statement to prevent fallthroughs.
        //Switch Expressions donâ€™t fall through anymore.
        //Furthermore, we can define multiple constants in the same label.
        //default case is now compulsory in Switch Expressions.
        //break is used in Switch Expressions to return values from a case itself.
